Two players click the white and shaded boxes in alternate rounds (stages). At each stage:

- player 1 chooses any four boxes that he hasnâ€™t chosen earlier (his picks are permanently marked with a gray half-fill)

- player 2 picks a shaded box in the range of boxed previously clicked by player 1 that he has not picked before (these are highlighted with light blue at his turn).

The player who first runs out of legitimate moves is the loser.
